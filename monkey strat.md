#### The Goal
Tired of long winded sieges on the first capture point? Want to get it over with ASAP?
This strat is for you. The goal is to bypass standard choke points and head strait to the
capture area for a quick win and crushing momentum. It has great surprise value and
steamrolls common defensive strategies as well as squishy defense team compositions.
Most defensive comps are built on the back of immobile heroes that are frequently set up
way past your ultimate goal, if you jump their line you cause panic and as they trickle in
or try to slowly move their setup you can wipe the team and take the point.

#### Where Do I Do Dis?
The strategy tends to shine on hybrid maps starting with a control point and switching to a payload. It also works quite well on pure Assault maps. I would advise against going __this__ monkey on escort maps, but if you really need to clear a fortified starting area this strat can do the job.

###### Best Maps
1. King's Row
2. Hollywood
3. Numbani
4. Hanamura
5. Temple of Anubis
6. Volskaya Industries *(little more hit or miss)*

#### Steps
1. Monkeys Rush past everything to the point capping and taking out priority targets.
2. Once distracted Lucio and Tobjourn run in.
3. Lucio distracts Monkey threats.
4. Tobjourn gets a turret up and running near the point.
5. Your about 1 min into the game and either have the point or not either way switch comp. unless the opposing team doesn't seem to be getting wise.

##### Monkey Priority
1. Turrets (Bastion or Tobjourn)
  * Monkeys don't deal with turrets exceedingly well 1v1, but with 2+ monkeys they will melt
  even behind a Reinhardt shield, swarm them first with safety in numbers.
  * If Bastion doesn't see you try to lead with a punch to the glowing blue crit spot on his
  back, it will strip his armor and allow you to get him down faster.
  * When you drop your shield make sure you aren't too close, sharing the inside of your shield
  costs you precious seconds of time under fire that can get you killed.
2. Symmetra turrets that are in range
  * Your teamates will want to come in ASAP and lasers make that a pain, if you see one in
  range take the millisecond to zap it.
  * Don't go running around chasing them though time is money.
3. Healers
  * Healers make the whole process of melting folks take time, so nixing them first speeds up
  the rush and stops stally healer ultimates
4. Symmetra, Snipers, Genjii, Pharah
  * Kill Symmetra before she can get a portal down. The idea is hit fast with no time for rebuttal,
  a Symmetra portal can go a long way for the enemy team. Snipers, Phara and Genjii are a threat to
  Tobjourn and Lucio if left unchecked and are easy targets so go ape.
5. Mei, Mcree, Reaper, Junkrat
  * These are threats to you, they'll hit you as hard or harder than you hit them, attack the ones
  go for the ones that are focused on other monkeys and avoid 1v1 tangos with them at all costs.
6. Anything left that is squishy
7. Tanks, especially roadhog
8. Kind monkeys shield their Torbjourn turrets before fresh meat arrives.

##### Lucio Priority
1. Get Tobjourn into position quickly once it's safe(ish).
2. Keep Monkey threats off the monkeys.
  * Use your right click to peel off Meis, Mcrees, Reapers and Junkrats from monkeys
3. Heal your buds
4. Drop the beet if things are looking grim, but you can usually save it for the following push/point.

##### Tobjourn Priority
1. Coordinate with Lucio for a speedy run to the point, this should be done a good few seconds after the monkeys have launched and probably around when you see the first kill pop up.
2. Drop that turret and get it to level 2, it should be somewhere with full view of the point and not in view of incoming enemies straight from their spawn. It doesn't need to be too sneaky, the enemies will be fairly distracted.
3. If you see Meis or Reapers doing some damage try to help focus them down. Don't solo engage away from that beautiful turret though.
4. Once your turrets in place go mop up that scrap and start throwing armor on the point. Make sure to give Lucio some love.
5. You are now a proud dwarf with a turret on the point, just do emotes or something as you get PotG, or you know... shoot stuff I guess.
